There are two players. In each round the player rolls dice how many times he wants to. Value of each roll is added to points in the round.
If "1" falls on the dice, the player looses all the points.
The player can choose "dost" ("enough") - the points are added to the total count of players points. After that, it is the second players turn.
The game ends when one of the players reaches 100 points
